				<div class="thought1">
					<p>I am not ecaping from reality - I'm finding it. My soul, at rest in the world of money
					and responsibilities, stretches and swells here. It fits my body perfectly instead of wearing
					my skin like a hand-me-down coat: not uncomfortable, but ill-fitting and not my style. - moon</p>

				<div class="thought2">
				<p>I become she who feels more intensely, sees in brighter colors, and smells the universe each morning.
				I live with abandon and belong exactly where I am. - moon</p>

				<div class="thought3">
				<p>My soul is wide awake, and every moment is a precious gift. - moon</p>

				<div class="thought4">
				<p>The wide world is all  about you: you can fence yorselves in, but you cannot forever fence it out - moon</p>

				<div class="thought5">
				<p>There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, 
				but it is not always quite the something you were after. - moon</p>
				</div>

				<div class="thought6">
				<p>Don't adventures ever end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story. - moon</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="thought7">
				<p>It's a dangerous business, going out of your door. You step onto the road and if you don't keep your feet, there's 
				no knowing where you might be swept off to. - moon</p>
