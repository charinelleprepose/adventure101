				<h4>Scotland</h4>
				<p>Scotland is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent 
				sovereign state in the Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, James VI, King
				of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland, thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms. Scotland
				subsequently entered into a political union with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of 
				Great Britain. The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain, which succeeded both the Parliament of 
				Scotland and the Parliament of England. In 1801, Great Britain itself entered into a political union with the Kingdom 
				of Ireland to create the  the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (in 1922, the Irish Free State seceded 
				from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland)</p>
